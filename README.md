# BootstrapCV_Demo
My CV displaying Bootstrap Components.
This demos a responsive design using Bootstrap which facilitates adapting a site for mobile clients.
It shamelessly show cases unnecessary components such as carousels, modals, forms and menus.
I apologise for the large footprint, normally I would gitignore bower_components, but if you don't have Bower installed on your
device you can just download this and open index.html in your browser.
